### Task 1

I used recursion to fully traverse the reporting structure tree and get the right number and the right reports. It was vague about what fully filled out ReportingStructure looked like, so I made that a string with first and last name like how readme.md has it. Alternative options could be a nested json structure. It is computed on the fly. 


### Task 2

I tested this well and it definitely persists the query.  Gives the full employee on the response.  Researched best fields to use for salary and effective date.  

### Other Notes

The sample data wasn't modified except to add one employee, myself to the end.  

### Testing
Tests in ChallengeApplicationTests class.  

### Put some images of working code in the top level folder
